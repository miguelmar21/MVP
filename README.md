# NewbieGainz <br><sup> By Miguel Regalado<sup>
This project, also known as MVP (Minimal viable product) was done in roughly 2 days to showcase what I can deliver in such a short time constraint. I am proud of what I accomplished in just two days and learned quite a lot about time and project management when given a time limit.
  
## INTRODUCTION
Have you ever wanted to go to the gym and change your life around but you were always overwhelmed by the world of weightlifting? Or perhaps you don't know how to do particular movements for certain muscle groups? Maybe you don't even know the names of the muscles in your body?
  
Well this is where NewbiewGainz comes into play. NewbieGainz is a mobile app designed for beginners who wish to learn new weightlifting exercises without having to know much about the gym to begin with. You can search these exercises by name, by muscle groups, or you can just look through all of the movements within this powerful workout API!

You can traverse through every exercise included in the API. The app automatically loads on the "All exercises" page, but you can go back to it by clicking on the left most button on the navigation menu. Each exercise includes its name, the targeted muscle group and body part, and the equipment needed to perform it.<br>
